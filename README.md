# G-Core Labs Demo - Video Calls

# Introduction  
Setup real-time communication between users  in 15 minutes in your iOS project instead of 7 days of work and setting parameters of codecs, network, etc. This demo project is a quick tutorial how to video call from your own mobile app to many users  

# Feature

1. Real time communication with WebRTC   
2. Playback video from remote users  
3. Flip camera, connection, moderator mode, portrait/lanscape, preview  

# Quick start

2. Ð¡onnect to the room using the link (check mark for Moderator mode)  
3. Enter a name, turn on video/audio on the preview screen

1. SDK - [GCoreVideoCallsSDK](https://bitbucket.gcore.lu/projects/VP/repos/ios_video_calls/browse/description_GCoreVideoCallsSDK.md?at=v1.0.1)   
To work with G-Core Labs services (video calls), we need GCoreVideoCallsSDK. This SDK allows you to establish a connection to the server and receive events from it, as well as send and receive data streams from other users.
2. Permissions  
To use the camera and microphone, you need to request the user's permission for this. To do this, add to the plist (Info) of the project: Privacy - Camera Usage Description and Privacy - Microphone Usage Description.
3. API   
The SDK receives events from the server and passes them to the client application using the RootListener delegate, the full set of methods is available [here](https://bitbucket.gcore.lu/projects/VP/repos/ios_video_calls/browse/description_GCoreVideoCallsSDK.md?at=v1.0.1)

# Requirements
